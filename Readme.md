This system uses AI-based face recognition to automate attendance efficiently.
A Smart Attendance System using Face Recognition is an automated solution designed to mark attendance by identifying individuals through their facial features. Traditional attendance methods such as manual registers, RFID cards, and fingerprint machines are time-consuming, prone to proxy attendance, unhygienic, and inefficient for large organizations.

This project leverages Computer Vision and Machine Learning techniques to recognize faces in real time and automatically record attendance in a secure database. The system provides a fast, contactless, and accurate attendance solution, suitable for educational institutions and organizations.

🎯 Objectives

To automate the attendance process using face recognition technology

To eliminate proxy attendance and ensure accurate identification of individuals

To store and manage attendance records digitally in a database

To generate daily, weekly, and monthly attendance reports

To reduce manual effort and improve operational efficiency

⚙️ Methodology

The Smart Attendance System follows a structured workflow:

Dataset Collection
Multiple face images of each user are captured using a webcam and stored in a dataset directory.

Image Preprocessing
Captured images are converted to grayscale and face regions are extracted for better recognition accuracy.

Model Training
The LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histogram) algorithm is used to train a face recognition model using labeled face images.

Real Time Face Detection & Recognition
The trained model detects faces in real time and matches them with stored identities.

Attendance Marking
On successful recognition, attendance is automatically recorded with user ID, date, and timestamp.

Data Storage & Report Generation
Attendance data is stored securely in a database and can be used for report generation.

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

Python – Core programming language

OpenCV – Face detection and recognition

NumPy & Pandas – Data processing

MySQL / SQLite – Attendance database
